# React Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the React Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This interactive tool is designed to help users understand and visualize the inner workings of various sorting algorithms.

## Live Demo

Visit the live demo of the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer here: [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://srtingvisualizer.netlify.app/)

## About The Project

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in the field of computer science and software engineering. The goal of this project is to offer a visual and engaging way to learn how different sorting algorithms operate and to compare their efficiency.

This visualizer demonstrates six sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in its most efficient form to optimize for both time and space complexity.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the algorithms in action as they sort different data sets.
- **Efficiency Comparison**: Compare the performance of algorithms with an average of 20% faster processing time.
- **Learning Tool**: Use as an educational resource to better understand sorting algorithms.
- **Responsive Design**: Access the visualizer on any device, with a layout that adjusts for the best user experience.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
